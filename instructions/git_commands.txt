Create new repository:  git init
Check out repository: git clone/path/to/repository
Add new file:  git add <filename> or git add *
Commit new changes:  git commit -m "Put message here."
Push new changes to master branch:  git push origin master
Check status:  git status
Create new branch and enter it:  git checkout -b <branchname>
Switch from one branch to another:  git checkout <branchname>
List all branches in repo & check which one you're in:  git branch
Fetch and merge changes to local host:  git pull
Merge to different branch:  git merge <branchname>
View all merge conflicts:  git diff
View conflicts against base:  git diff --base <filename>
Preview changes before merge:  git diff <sourcebranch> <targetbranch>
Tag with version number:  git tag 1.0.0 <commitID>
Undo and replace with last content:  git checkout -- <filename>


Step one:
Pull your repo to your local host, always ensure you haven't made changes to any files BEFORE doing this.  (git pull)

Step two:
Switch to production branch (git checkout production)

Step three:  
Now that your files are all the most recent and up-to-date files and you are safely out of the master branch, you can open them and make changes to them safely.  

Step four:
Commit the new changes (git commit -m "Put in a message explaining your changes")

Step five:
Please be sure to not push changes to master branch until you are 100% certain you will not break anything.  Push to the production environment, not the live environment.  
(git push)

Step six: 
Test

Step seven:
Push to master if everything looks good.
